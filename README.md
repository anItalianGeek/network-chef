# Network Subnetting and Supernetting Tool

## Overview

This project is a Java application built using NetBeans, designed to assist users in subnetting and supernetting IP networks. The program features a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can specify the number of hosts for each subnet, and the program will determine the IP range for each subnet. Additionally, the application supports supernetting: users can provide two IP addresses, and the program will calculate and return a single IP address representing the supernet.

## Features

- **Subnetting**: 
  - Users can specify the number of hosts for each subnet.
  - The program calculates and displays the IP range for each subnet.
- **Supernetting**:
  - Users can input two IP addresses.
  - The program calculates and displays the resulting supernet IP address.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- NetBeans IDE 8.2 or higher

## Usage

1. **Subnetting**:
   - Launch the application.
   - Enter the starting IP address in the designated field.
   - Specify the number of hosts for each subnet in the input fields.
   - Click on the `Cook the networks` button.
   - The application will display the IP range for each subnet.

2. **Supernetting**:
   - Launch the application.
   - Enter two IP addresses in the designated fields.
   - Click on the `Cook the network` button.
   - The application will display the resulting supernet IP address.

## Version

- **Current Version**: 1.1
  - Added support for supernetting: users can provide two IP addresses to calculate a single supernet IP.
